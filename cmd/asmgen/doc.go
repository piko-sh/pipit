// Command asmgen generates Plan 9 assembly (.s) and header (.h) files for the pipit
// bytecode interpreter dispatch loop and vectormaths SIMD functions.
//
// It produces architecture-specific output for amd64 and arm64 from shared,
// architecture-neutral handler definitions. It can also run in a validation mode that
// compares generated output against files on disk for CI use.

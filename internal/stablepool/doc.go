// Package stablepool is a pre-warmed, GC-surviving, sharded object pool.
//
// The defining property is in the name: objects are stable. Once the pool is constructed,
// its capacity is committed up-front and the contents persist across every Go GC cycle.
// There is no first-call allocation penalty, no victim-cache cliff after GC, and no
// surprise re-initialisation. In return, the pool's memory footprint matches the
// requested capacity. stablepool does not shrink under memory pressure (use ModeGCAware
// if you want that trade-off).
//
// # When to use stablepool
//
//   - Long-lived services where post-GC latency must stay flat.
//   - Hot paths whose pooled objects carry non-trivial allocated state (preallocated
//     buffers, maps, builders) that you want preserved across reuses, because sync.Pool
//     drops these on GC and forces re-allocation.
//   - Workloads where you know the working set up front and prefer a fixed memory floor
//     over dynamic shrinkage.
//
// # When NOT to use stablepool
//
//   - Sporadic / bursty workloads where the memory floor matters more than post-GC
//     latency: use ModeGCAware (sync.Pool semantics under the same typed API) or use
//     sync.Pool directly.
//   - Short-lived pools where the pre-warm cost dominates total cost.
//
// # Modes
//
// modePersistent (the default) is slab-backed, GC-surviving, and pre-warmed at New().
// ModeGCAware provides sync.Pool-equivalent reclamation with a typed API surface.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// Get() and Put() are safe for any number of concurrent goroutines. Each goroutine takes
// a per-P fast slot under runtime.procPin() (non-atomic in non-race builds,
// atomic.Pointer in race builds), then falls through to a sharded counted-pointer Treiber
// free stack on miss, and finally to a cross-shard steal walk. Growth, if enabled via
// WithGrowth(), appends new slabs under a single mutex. Growth events are rare and only
// fire when every shard is empty.
//
// The free stack is ABA-safe. A 16-bit generation counter is packed into the high bits of
// the 48-bit slab-slot pointer. Every successful CAS bumps the counter, closing the
// Treiber ABA window.
//
// # Intrusive Link
//
// Types stored in a stablepool Pool[T] MUST embed Link as their first field.
//
//	type MyObject struct {
//	    stablepool.Link
//	    Name string
//	    Buf  []byte
//	}
//
// Link is one pointer wide. The pool writes it when the object is on the free stack and
// leaves it untouched while the object is in user hands.
//
// # Build tags
//
// Production builds use non-atomic per-P slot access under procPin(). Race builds (-race)
// automatically swap in atomic.Pointer[T] for the slot so the detector accepts the
// cross-goroutine accesses produced by Ps that rotate between goroutines.

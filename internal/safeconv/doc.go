// Package safeconv provides safe integer type conversions with bounds checking.
//
// These functions convert between integer types by clamping values to the target type's
// valid range rather than allowing overflow. This prevents gosec G115 (integer overflow)
// issues and provides predictable behaviour when narrowing integer types.
//
// # Design rationale
//
// Clamping (saturating at the target type's minimum or maximum) was chosen over
// truncation or panicking. Truncation silently discards high bits, which can turn a large
// positive value into a small or even negative one with no indication that anything went
// wrong. Panicking would crash at runtime, which is disproportionate for application code
// where overflow typically indicates unexpected input rather than a logic error. Clamping
// preserves the closest representable value and keeps the program running.
//
// # Conversion behaviour
//
// All functions follow a consistent clamping pattern:
//
//   - Negative values are clamped to 0 for unsigned targets
//   - Values exceeding the target's maximum are clamped to that maximum
//   - Values below the target's minimum (for signed types) are clamped to that minimum
//
// # Usage
//
//	// Convert potentially large int to uint32 safely
//	size := safeconv.IntToUint32(someInt)
//
//	// Generic conversion for cross-platform code
//	bytes := safeconv.ToUint64(statfs.Bsize)
//
// # Thread safety
//
// All functions are pure and stateless; they are safe for concurrent use.

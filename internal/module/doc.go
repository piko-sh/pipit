// Package module defines the language-level contract for loading Go-as-bytecode modules
// into a pipit interpreter at runtime.
//
// Owns the types that cross the boundary between pipit (the interpreter) and its hosts:
//
//   - [Ref]: how compiled code references a module dependency by path + version +
//     integrity pin.
//   - [Descriptor]: what a module IS - declared capabilities, pinned stdlib version,
//     exported symbol allowlist.
//   - [Bundle]: the on-disk / on-wire artefact pairing a descriptor with its compiled
//     bytecode.
//   - [Capability]: a single capability claim (axis + scope) the host's CapabilityHook
//     interprets.
//   - [Provider]: the port a host implements to resolve a Ref into a Bundle.
